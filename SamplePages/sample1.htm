<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The author raises a number of interesting questions after citing several path-breaking research studies. Why, indeed, aren't school systems adopting some of these techniques known to improve children's learning and problem-solving ability? Quite a few mathematicians have written critiques of United States practice in teaching primary and secondary school mathematics, informed by practice in other countries, for example Hung-hsi Wu,<p><a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_2.pdf</a><p><a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_3.pdf</a><p><a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf</a><p><a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NoticesAMS2011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NoticesAMS2011.pdf</a><p>Richard Askey,<p><a href="http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf</a><p><a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf</a><p>Roger E.

I think so too after living in Taiwan twice in my adult life (January 1982 through February 1985, and December 1998 through July 2001). Taiwan is not the only place where elementary mathematics instruction is better than it is in the United States. Chapter 1: "International Student Achievement in Mathematics" from the TIMSS 2007 study of mathematics achievement in many different countries includes, in Exhibit 1.1 (pages 34 and 35)<p><a href="http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>a chart of mathematics achievement levels in various countries. Although the United States is above the international average score among the countries surveyed, as we would expect from the level of economic development in the United States, the United States is well below the top country listed, which is Singapore. An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I've been curious about mathematics education in Singapore ever since I heard of these results from an earlier TIMSS sample in the 1990s.<p>The article "The Singaporean Mathematics Curriculum: Connections to TIMSS"<p><a href="http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>by a Singaporean author explains some of the background to the Singapore math materials and how they approach topics that are foundational for later mathematics study. I am amazed that persons from Singapore in my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World) and were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Malay or Indian languages like Tamil) and yet received very thorough instruction in mathematics. I hope that all of us here in the United States can do at least that well in the current generation.<p>P.S. Another reply mentions the Flynn effect (secular increase in raw scores on IQ tests from generation to generation in most countries worldwide), and links to the Wikipedia article. Thanks for bringing that up. Being aware that the Wikipedia article on that subject has been subject to edit wars that have gone to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee,<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>I think it may be helpful to link to another source about the Flynn effect<p><a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/" rel="nofollow">http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/</a><p>that has had the influence of better informed and more impartial editors.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I have no doubt that math teaching methods in the US are terrible, in general.  And I am very open to the possibility that Singapore does it much better.  But however poor Singapore was in the past, it is now <i>3rd</i> in the world in per-capita PPP GDP while the US is 7th (according to the IMF; $56,522 vs. $47,284).<p>Furthermore we should always expect the top countries to be small ones; if each state in the US (pop. ~300m) was considered individually, it seems very likely that several would be more highly ranked than Singapore (pop. ~5m).  Seeing as that those states are much more alike to the rest of the US--in terms of culture, government, etc.--than is Singapore, shouldn't we be looking to them for guidance on how to improve the rest of the US?</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2562907&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563177 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563177&dir=up&by=giu&auth=e69e1427eb228e07d7b49a1d3efbbf4f2edd6c16&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Personally, I don't think the situation is nearly as gloomy in the US as a lot of my fellows seem to. It's a characteristic of nation citizens to be over hard on certain aspects of their community.<p>As a matter of fact, if the US school system is partly or significantly responsible for the productivity and creativity of adult residents, I'm pretty satisfied with it on the whole. I'm not sure studying to tests produces the best outcomes. I'm more interested in novel problem solving, invention, and innovation, and typical international standardized tests don't suss that out especially well, do they?<p>Moreover, it's hard to know what to infer when comparing a giant, multicultural country with a small, much more homogeneous one such as Singapore. It makes sense that some small countries might outperform the US at testing in the same way that you expect some small countries to have a higher per capita gdp. Unless I miss my guess, we could cherry pick some communities in the US that do better on either than Singapore.<p>This article about US test scores, after adjusting for demographics, was discussed on HN before, although I can't find the link just now:<p><a href="http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html" rel="nofollow">http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-abou...</a><p>It's extremely interesting, and I haven't seen anything that impeaches it.<p>That's not to say that I think the US school system does not have huge room for improvement. That's clear, and I'm hopeful that continued technological development and research will provide amazing breakthroughs. Moreover, we're not even using some of the best methods that are already available; research suggests the Montessorri method is advantageous, and indeed my own son was trained at one, and we were much happier with the result in comparison to his time at a public elementary school.<p>But it's not necessary to down talk where we're at to motivate improvement. What I <i>don't</i> want to see is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. US schools get some things right. Students come out believing they can do anything. They're not afraid to try new approaches. I'd rather not end up with test taking automatons who are mainly expert at memorization and thoughtless skills drills.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2562978&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563084 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563084&dir=up&by=giu&auth=b4e5222baab520c539498ae63ce19eb0a73d1a2e&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that mathematics in general leads to what you say (instructional techniques aside), but I'm rather arguing that it's not necessarily the mathematical techniques that are the primary thing at fault (however I do agree that it is massively lacking and misguided, as he is saying), but rather that more generalized instructional techniques and learning environments and structures are equally at fault.  Students don't test poorly solely because the math instruction was that much poorer than elsewhere, but rather that the student, to due a good number of factors, wasn't inclined to learn, and rather "get by through whatever means" (or whatever other reason), as is so common in our society.  That doesn't lead to exceptional skills in analysis, problem solving, or general logic.<p>Lastly, judging by his HN about page I wouldn't say his field of expertise is specifically mathematics, but rather that he has much broader educational expertise.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563048&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563578 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563578&dir=up&by=giu&auth=f429d53603921eaf44c319c6224981df124fcc1a&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>IMO, the biggest problem with education is how crackpot the teacher teaching system is. They seem to have no more scientific basis than Postmodernism, despite the fact that they actually research something that can be research.<p>There's a book called "Why Don't Students Like School: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom". The author explains (more or less) why Direct Instruction is so much more successful than other, newer, faddish techniques. Actually, Direct Instruction is also a bit faddish, and could certainly be improved by a more scientific approach.<p>Unfortunately, teacher trainers think that drill work is boring, and anything that recommends drill work must be wrong, because it is (to them) unpleasant. Maybe not as unpleasant as studying stuff you don't understand (which is what happens if you don't drill), but they don't have to accept reality.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563578&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563290 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563290&dir=up&by=giu&auth=336b82d7dbe2e89b8113969054fb43612be314db&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The author juxtaposes his recommendations against his unnamed professor's claim that intelligence is genetic and fixed at birth, pointing out that there are broad classes of behaviors that can improve our intelligence --  but he neglects half of the response to his professor's genetic predestination view, namely the whole host of physical/chemical/biological factors impacting both brain development and cognition later in life.<p>As just an example, I was recently impressed by a study (<a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1529/2147.full.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1529/2147...</a>) demonstrating improvements on both a memory task and an intelligence task through creatine supplements. The explanation suggested by the authors (and it looks like some other literature as well, though I haven't really dug into it yet) is basically that creatine is part of a mechanism for rapid ATP synthesis, that the ion pumps in your neurons run on ATP, and that if you're sometimes "fuel-limited" (their word) creatine levels matter, in the same way that oxygen and glucose do. This make sense, but I was quite surprised to read this, I think in part because I'm used to seeing my brain as being a relatively static thing. Stepping down a level of abstraction, and thinking about the instant to instant chemical resource needs of individual cells and gates is kind of eye-opening. And for all I know there's hundreds or thousands of other documented effects, where increasing or decreasing the presence of some reagent associated with running ion pumps, or growing axons or synthesizing neurotransmitters has some measurable effect on intelligence.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2562899&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563120 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563120&dir=up&by=giu&auth=45b763ace396833fe533dc38b4f86e17d5af22ac&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I had absolutely zero idea what TL;DR meant until I saw it here and looked it up. I agree with you, this article was extremely well-written and I feel that just summarizing the key points doesn't really help you to understand what the author was trying to convey. It's unfortunate that we've trained ourselves as a society to participate in info-snacking (gorging ourselves on as many tiny bits of info as possible). This is why there's so much short-form content. As opposed to circulating great content like this article (and subsequently discussing it), we go out of our way to publish less-circumstantial lists ad nausea that make us feel like we've done/learned something.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563773&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563195 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563195&dir=up&by=giu&auth=5c2f6207d968243193f8991dc2da3d49eb50d403&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I hear you, but that way lie dragons.<p>Ultimately, you will be the only person capable of deciding whether a particular thing was worth your time or not, and you can only decide that in hindsight, having experienced it.

Accepting that, would you then rather memorize a pile of summaries and tidbits and factoids, or would you rather take the time to read and consider a complete discourse on a subject?<p>For example: I'm sitting here thinking about my argument and wondering if I'm really just full of shit, but then I suddenly remembered a bit of "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman", where Feynman talks about some of his experiences in Brazil, and how the teaching at the time resulted in students that had memorized everything but understood very little.<p>And it strikes me that this relatively recent addiction to summaries is very similar to that kind of Brazilian education.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563051&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563068 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563068&dir=up&by=giu&auth=034f7ab83f142d767e9050093428eb611394388a&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>An interesting comparison.  Largely accurate, I think, but I do want to make a counter-point:<p>reading a summary != memorization<p>The problem with students who only memorize is that they are incapable of <i>creation</i>.  They can answer a set of questions, but not use what they know to respond to something new.  A summary, in the best cases (far from always achieved, of course), is all that is needed to get a thinking brain from zero to the conclusions the full text would bring you to.  Any gaps can be logically deduced and filled through mental effort, ideally more quickly than it could be told.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not sure about the counter-point. I'm trying to think of the cases where I might agree, and about the only one I can think of is the summaries of papers in scientific journals, where the reader is already pretty familiar with that specific subject. (And I'm really undecided about even that.)<p>I think context -- all of the nuances and subtleties and justifications and reasonings surrounding a statement -- is pretty important, and without that context, you still end up with gaps. They're just, maybe, slightly different gaps than you get from memorization.<p>I tried to spring a trap on some unsuspecting HN'r downthread to make this point. If you just take the bullet points -- say, "2. Challenge yourself" -- by themselves, then you miss out on the point that repeatedly doing the same challenging activity doesn't get the desired result. And if you get that point by reading some of the comments here, then you might miss out on <i>why</i> it's important to take on different challenges, and therefore what kind of challenges would be most beneficial. And, if you skim the article, you might miss out on the author's justifications for these suggestions in the first place, which would leave you stumped if someone asked you why novelty mattered.<p>It's true that you could go back and fill in these gaps, or possibly even derive answers to them on your own, but if you're going to expect to do that, why not just read the thing in its entirety to begin with?</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563108&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563242 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563242&dir=up&by=giu&auth=19bb99cb645e7cbf36e8c0dade5dede0928d8ca4&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; <i>Aren't they just as susceptible to misunderstanding the content as well?</i><p>Yep! The only distinction between skimming and reading a summary is that skimming at least gives you the opportunity to spot something interesting, stop, and read it fully.<p>I also wouldn't confuse speed-reading with skimming, so long as the speed-reading gleaned as much from the text as slower reading would.<p>&#62; <i>I believe that summaries [and skimming] are definitely useful and do not detract from the spreading of information or the gaining of knowledge.

I'm being more vocal about it nowadays because "TL:DR" has recently become a "thing", and I'm concerned that larger numbers of people seem to be considering it acceptable to skip reading a 10-minute article in favor of reading a 10-second summary of it.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>#4) Do things the hard way. It's hard for me to agree with this. In principle, I want to bemoan the decline of my ability to spell as a result of auto-correct. But I think that casts an unfair negative light on the idea of doing things "the easy way".<p>Think about math. There is no question that the Arabic numbering system makes doing math easier. Why should I to go back to scratching out base-60 cuneiform? I can challenge myself just as easily by pushing on to more powerful and abstract mathematical concepts made possible by timesavers like the Arabic numbering system.<p>I'm sure that having access to high-level languages limits my understanding of the bits and bytes. But I can use these new tools of abstraction to do things that I would have found impossible if I were writing machine code. I'm not sure I see the value in doing things the hard way, when my brain will be challenged enough probing the depths of what these new innovations have made possible. I think the author misses one crucial part of intelligence - intelligence, insofar as it is about abstract thought, is positively correlated with the sorts of things I can do without thinking about them.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2563047&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2563105 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2563105&dir=up&by=giu&auth=0ac6383663e334d92ad18956aad164a3d231e320&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't agree with the downvotes here. I tend to think people downvote short comments without really attempting to understand the value they're bringing to the conversation. Conversely, people assume a long comment is insightful.<p>It is a reasonable explanation that any increase in intelligence is just the subject getting better at the tests that are measuring intelligence. If you take the same IQ test over again, you're likely going to score a bit higher. But this certainly doesn't mean the act of taking the test made you smarter. You're simply getting better at using the tool used to measure intelligence.<p>This made sense at least before the most recent study cited with the Dual-N-Back training.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>'#4 Do Things The Hard Way'<p>I think this is so important for our young generation b/c everybody is trying to "hack" or "game" the system. The problem is that you don't actually internalize things by hacking your way through<p>So it depends on your goals. Let's take a computer science degree for example: if your goal is to do investment banking and having a CS/engineering degree from a top university really puts you apart from all those econ/business majors in the finance interviews (which it does), sure hack your way through CS/EE: you're not planning to go into that field anyways so copy-change homework and study past tests to hack the system and get a good GPA. But if you're doing CS to be a software engineer, you DON'T want to hack your way through, you'd want to "do things the hard way" and really learn the material.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=2562742&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2562752 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=2562752&dir=up&by=giu&auth=979fba9cbd463cf4fbc5b50d8919ce52635855b0&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%32%35%36%32%36%33%32"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><br>

"Ok so everyone has an A, but we have 2 weeks left and I have more material I would like to cover so please show up." Not only that but he actually knew how to teach so you where ready to use the material in the future.<p>Unfortunately I knew a history teacher who like to base essay questions off of obscure references in the ~3,000 pages of text you where apparently supposed to memorize for the test.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Try to fit math ideas.<p>What does zero mean? what does one mean? does addition make sense? can you take the limit of something? What if something blows up to infinity?<p>So... try cars. zero being no car. one being a "standard" car. say a honda civic. how much honda can you take a way and still be a car? like taking the limit at zero. There are crazy efficient cars with tiny little internal combustion engines and bicycle wheels that get 100+ mpg but piss poor acceleration. hmm. what would a car be at the other end? a ferrari? Do cars associate? do cars commute? :)<p>Creativity isn't painting. It's looking at the same crap you look at all the time and playing with it. Math has a lot of tricks for labeling things, then seeing what shows up when you try do stuff with the labels.
